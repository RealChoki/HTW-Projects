## ImproveSpell

In this thrilling terminal mini game, your quick reflexes will be put to the test! As soon as you press the enter key, a countdown begins. 
Once the countdown reaches zero and the word "GO" appears in the terminal, the game will reveal the name of a spell, 
and it's up to you to type it in lightning-fast.

But here's the catch: a timer starts running as soon as you press enter, and you must enter the spell's name before time runs out. 
Each spell will have a unique name, so be prepared.
