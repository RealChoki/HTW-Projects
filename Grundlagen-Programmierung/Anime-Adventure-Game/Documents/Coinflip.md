## Coinflip

As the game begins, a mesmerizing ASCII art animation appears on the screen, depicting a coin spinning through the air. 
The anticipation builds as the coin starts to slow down, ready to reveal its fate. With bated breath, you await the outcome.

Suddenly, the spinning coin comes to a halt, and the art transforms into a clear depiction of the coin landing on either heads or tails. 
If fortune smiles upon you and it lands on heads, you'll be rewarded with a delightful +10 berris. 
Your virtual wallet grows fatter, and your excitement soars!

However, if the coin reveals tails, it's not all lost. You'll experience a minor setback of -10 berris. 
Don't worry, thoughâ€”it's just a small bump in the road, and there's always another flip to turn your luck around.

So go on! Fulfill your gambling needs!
